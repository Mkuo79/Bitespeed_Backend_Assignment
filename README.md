Hello there!
I have hosted my node.js backend on https://b0f47861e9e0.ngrok-free.app using ngrok and I have defined three endpoints

/identify - As required in assignment 

/contacts - to view Contacts table 

/delete - For deleting a record (soft delete)

I have SQL server instance on docker and to avoid cost charges I have not deployed it on Azure or other cloud based platform. Please review the code and in case there 
are issues with connectivity, reach out to me on mahipk79@gmail.com while reviewing the assignment. I'll restart the server if it gets paused. 

I have not hosted on Renderworld because at the moment I cannot share my machine's IP address. 
I am quite excited for the interview procedure!!!
Regards,
Mahip Khandelwal
